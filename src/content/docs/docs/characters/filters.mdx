import {baseEndpoint} from '../../../../constants/api.js'
import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';


You can also get data filtered with params. To start filtering add `?` and then make sure to follow next pattern `query=value` and a `&` to separate each query. For example `?name=finn`.
Available queries are:
- `name`
- `full_name`
- `specie`

## Example 
<Code code={`${baseEndpoint}/characters?specie=human&name=fi`} lang="js" title="Endpoint" />

In this case we're using the `get all characters` endpoint to get data and we are filtering by `specie` and `name`. The result will be all the characters that are humans and have a name that starts with `fi`.

<Code code={`${baseEndpoint}/characters/paginated?specie=human&name=fi`} lang="js" title="Endpoint" />
